= Path expressions

A path expression is a standalone xref:path.adoc[concrete path] used as an
expression.
It resolves to one of these items:

* A local variable
* A xref:constant-items.adoc[constant item]
* A generic const parameter

== Local Variables

The simplest path expression is a single identifier referring to a local
variable:

[source,cairo]
----
const fn unwrap_or<+Destruct<T>>(self: Option<T>, default: T) -> T {
    match self {
        Some(x) => x,
        None => default,
    }
}
----

Here `x` and `default` are path expressions that evaluate to local variables.

Variables bound in patterns are also local variables. In the example above,
`x` is bound by the pattern `Some(x)`.

== Constants

A path expression can refer to a constant item using a qualified path:

[source,cairo]
----
mod config {
    pub const MAX_SIZE: u32 = 100;
}

fn check_size(size: u32) -> bool {
    size <= config::MAX_SIZE
}
----

The path `config::MAX_SIZE` is a path expression that evaluates to the constant
value defined in the `config` module.
