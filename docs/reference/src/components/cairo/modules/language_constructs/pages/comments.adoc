= Comments

Cairo supports three types of comments: line comments, doc comments, and
module-level doc comments.
All comments follow the general C++/Rust style.

== Line Comments

Line comments begin with `//` and continue to the end of the line.
They are used for explanatory notes within code:

[source,cairo]
----
// Test simple access.
let ba: ByteArray = "AB";
let span = ba.span();
----

== Doc Comments

Doc comments begin with `///` and are used to document items like types,
functions, and traits.
They appear directly before the item they document:

[source,cairo]
----
/// A `Box` is a type that points to a wrapped value.
/// It allows for cheap moving around of the value, as its size is small, and may wrap a large size.
pub extern type Box<T>;
----

Doc comments support markdown formatting and are typically used to generate
documentation.

== Module-level Doc Comments

Module-level doc comments begin with `//!` and document the containing module
itself.
They typically appear at the top of a file:

[source,cairo]
----
//! Overloadable operators.
//!
//! Implementing these traits allows you to overload certain operators.
//!
//! > Note: Other overloadable operators are also defined in the
//! > [`core::traits`] module.
----

Module-level doc comments provide an overview of the module's purpose and
contents.
