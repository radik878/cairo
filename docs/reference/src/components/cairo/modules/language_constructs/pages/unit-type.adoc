= Unit type

The _unit type_ is a type with exactly one value, written as `()`.
It represents the absence of a meaningful value and is used for functions that
perform side effects but don't return data.

== Characteristics

The unit type is represented by an empty tuple: the
xref:literal-expressions.adoc[unit literal] `()`.

Its size is zero and it is guaranteed to not exist in compiled code.

== Common Uses

Functions that perform actions but don't return meaningful data use `()`:

[source,cairo]
----
pub fn assert_eq<T, +PartialEq<T>>(a: @T, b: @T, err_code: felt252) {
    assert(a == b, err_code);
}
----

When a function doesn't explicitly return a value, it returns `()` implicitly.

xref:if-expressions.adoc[If expressions] without an `else` branch also
evaluate to `()` when the condition is false.

== Comparison with Never Type

The unit type `()` is different from the xref:never-type.adoc[never type]:

* **Unit type `()`**: Has one value, represents "no meaningful data"
* **Never type `never`**: Has no values, represents "never returns"
