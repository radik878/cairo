= Identifiers

An identifier is a sequence of alphanumeric characters and underscores used to
name language constructs.

== Rules

- Must start with a letter or underscore
- Can contain letters, digits, and underscores
- A single underscore `_` is not an identifier (means "no identifier")
- Cairo xref:keywords.adoc[keywords] cannot be used as identifiers

== Examples

[source,cairo]
----
fn main() {
    let variable_name = 10;
    let _unused = 20;  // Underscore prefix for unused variables
    let value123 = 30;
}
----

== Case Sensitivity

Cairo is case-sensitive. Identifiers that differ by case are distinct:

[source,cairo]
----
fn main() {
    let value = 1;
    let Value = 2;  // Different identifier
    let VALUE = 3;  // Also different
}
----

== Unused Variables

Identifiers starting with an underscore indicate intentionally unused variables
and silence unused warnings:

[source,cairo]
----
fn main() {
    let _unused = 42;  // No warning
    let used = 10;     // Warning if not used
}
----
